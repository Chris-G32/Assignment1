# Git Repository Readme

This Git repository contains the following files and folders:

- `BashScripts/`: A folder that contains Bash scripts.
- `producer.cpp`: A C++ source code file that implements a producer.
- `consumer.cpp`: A C++ source code file that implements a consumer.
- `shared.hpp`: A C++ header file that contains shared definitions used by both producer and consumer.

## BashScripts

This folder contains Bash scripts used to automate certain tasks related to the producer and consumer processes.

## producer.cpp

This is a C++ source code file that implements a producer. The producer generates data and writes it to a shared buffer.

## consumer.cpp

This is a C++ source code file that implements a consumer. The consumer reads data from the shared buffer and processes it.

## shared.hpp

This is a C++ header file that contains shared definitions used by both the producer and consumer. These definitions include data structures, constants, and function declarations that are used to communicate between the two processes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to clone it to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>


Once you have cloned the repository, you can compile and run the producer and consumer processes. Make sure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine.

g++ -o producer producer.cpp shared.hpp
g++ -o consumer consumer.cpp shared.hpp
After compiling, you can run the producer and consumer processes in separate terminal windows:

./producer
./consumer
